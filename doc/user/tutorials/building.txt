Building Lumiera from source
============================

Currently, after building the application, you can try out the Lumiera GUI
and you can run the test suite. This tutorial details the basic procedure
to compile Lumiera on a Linux (or comparable) system. We'll assume that
the reader has acquired basic _commandline survival skills_ and is able
to figure out the usage of the Git version management system from the
documentation (but we'll mention each actually required command
explicitly)

NOTE: just compiling Lumieara on a _Debian-based_ system (e.g. Ubuntu)
      is much simpler using the Debian source package. See the separate
      link:DebianBuilding.html[tutorial page] for this (or the general
      link:/debian/[instructions for installing on Debian/Ubuntu]).
      The purpose of this tutorial here is to show you the elementary
      and generic steps to compile Lumiera from source.

For building Lumiera, besides the GNU C/C++ compiler (Version 4.X), you will need:

 * link:http://git-scm.com/[Git VCS]
 * link:http://www.scons.org/[SCons build system]
 * link:http://www.boost.org/[Boost libraries]
 * link:http://gmerlin.sourceforge.net/[GAVL library]
 * *NoBug* (see below)

The GUI depends on:

 * http://www.gtkmm.org/en/[gtkmm]
 * http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libXv[libXv]

TIP: Generally speaking, when you want to build software, you need the
_development_ version of the packages, containing the headers and pre-built
libraries to link against. Usually, these packages are named `-devel` or `-dev`

For Debian based systems, e.g. Ubuntu, you can install these dependencies with:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
sudo apt-get install build-essential autoconf scons valgrind libtool git-core \
libboost-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-regex-dev libboost-filesystem-dev \
libgavl-dev libgdl-1-dev libgtkmm-2.4-dev librsvg2-dev libxv-dev
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Optionally, you may also want to install the *gtk2-engines* package.


Build directory
---------------

You need a directory for checking out the sources and running the build. This
could be a temp directory, or some "workspace" directory below your home
directory. We'll call it _workspace directory_ from now on.

Lumiera specific libraries
--------------------------

Now that you have your basic build system setup, Lumiera needs a few more
special support libraries.  Currently you need to build those from source and
install them, so the Lumiera build process can pick them up.

WARNING: Note that the following procedures will try to install files into your
base system below `/usr/local`.

To do so, you'll need administrative permissions for the machine you're working
on. These additions might interfere with other libraries installed by your
package manager (if you get into trouble updating your system later on,
sometimes you need to remove these manually built libraries).

Installing NoBug
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*NoBug* is an instrumentation and diagnostics library. +
Go into the mentioned _workspace direcory_ (maybe create a new
directory). First, let's get the NoBug source code:

------------------------------------------------------------
git clone git://git.pipapo.org/nobug
------------------------------------------------------------

This will create a (sub)directory called nobug with source code in your current
directory. +
Compile NoBug with the following commands

------------------------------------------------------------
cd nobug
autoreconf -i
mkdir build
cd build
../configure
make
sudo make install
------------------------------------------------------------

Installing GDL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *GNOME Docking library* is generally available through your package manager,
but we contributed some improvements, which are only available in the very
recent development versions of GDL. If your distribution provides a GDL >= 2.27,
you're fine. Otherwise we've created a special package, which doesn't interfere
with an existing (older) installation of GDL.

Ubuntu 9.04 note::
  intltool-update is not patched, you must add +/usr/share/intltool-debian/+
  to get the gdl-package to configure correctly (JSC).
Ubuntu 10.10 note::
  you need to install the +intltool+ package from the standard ubuntu repository

------------------------------------------------------------
git clone git://git.lumiera.org/gdl-package
cd gdl-package
./configure
make
sudo make install
------------------------------------------------------------

For more detailed instructions on how to build GDL (also how to build it into a
Debian package) see
http://lists.lumiera.org/pipermail/lumiera/2009-April/000891.html[this message +
on the Lumiera mailing list].


check library linkage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The compile will warn you to add various directories to /etc/ld.so.conf and then
run ldconfig. This will allow your dynamic liker to pick up the newly built
libraries later when you try to start Lumiera.  If you don't want to reconfigure
your system and add `/usr/local/lib` to the mentioned linker configuration, you
may alternatively just add the directories to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
variable.

Either way, check that all libraries are accessible and OK:

------------------------------------------------------------
sudo ldconfig -v | grep 'nobug'
------------------------------------------------------------

and you should get a list of the libraries, part of which should look like this:

------------------------------------------------------------
        libnobug.so.0 -> /usr/local/lib/libnobug.so.0.0.0
        libnobugmt.so.0 -> /usr/local/lib/libnobugmt.so.0.0.0
        libgdl-lum.so.0 -> /usr/local/lib/libgdl-lum.so.0.0.0
------------------------------------------------------------

or similar. The same holds true for 'libgdl-lum.so.0' if you needed to build it
explicitly for your system. If any if these libraries are not listed,
investigate why before continuing. 


Building Lumiera
----------------

Up to now, Lumiera has had two maintained (and equivalent) build systems: *scons* and
*autotools*. (Note 3/2011: Right now, the autotools build is broken. It is always a good
idea to check the current build stats from our *builddrone*, which automatically builds
the latest version from master repository. Please have a look at this
http://lumiera.org/builddrone/table.html[current build stats]-page.)

Next, after having built and installed the prerequisite libraries, go into the
_workspace directory_ to retrieve the Lumiera source code and build it.


 * to retrieve the source code with git and then build with *scons*:
+ 
(see available build options by issuing `scons -h` )
+
-----------------
git clone git://git.lumiera.org/LUMIERA
cd LUMIERA
scons
-----------------
+
   
 * alternatively, if you prefer building with *autotools* _(not working currently 3/11)_:
+
-----------------
git clone git://git.lumiera.org/LUMIERA
cd LUMIERA
autoreconf -fi
mkdir build
cd build
../configure
make
-----------------

maybe build and run the test suite by issuing `scons check` or `make check`

This will take some time.

NOTE: you do not need to _install_ Lumiera. It will find its required files
relative to the generated directory structure, which is freely relocatable
as a whole. Just invoke the +target/lumiera+ executable. The current
working directory is not relevant.

After the build has finished successfully, you should be able to start Lumiera.
Currently, this will bring up the GUI, without any further functionality

You should see something like:
