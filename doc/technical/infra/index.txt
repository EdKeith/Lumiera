Infrastructure
==============


Various details, documentation and other pieces of information regarding
the infrastructure of the Lumiera project. This includes the infrastructure
used for building and maintaining documentation and website.

 * see link:../build/index.html[separate page for the Buildsystem]
 * generating the link:MenuGen.html[navigation menu] for the website
 * how to use the link:rfcsh.html[rfc.sh] script for maintaining RFC's



Other tools in the ./admin folder
---------------------------------

There are various other small tools and scripts in the admin folder which are
not yet fully documented (Read the Source!).

.headercheck
This is a small tool which checks that all headers are sufficiently standalone
and include anything they need. In future we might extend this to find out
bogus includes by predefining (-D) headerguards they include, effectively
disableing this include for a test.

.render_icon.py
used by the buildsystem to translate svg icons to bitmaps (png)

.treeinfo.sh
Generates a report about the projects directory structure by parsing the
DIR_INFO files (which have to be maintained manually)

A DIR_INFO is just a small text file where the first line shall give a short
summary about the purpose of this directory followed by arbitary text giving
more details.

.git_hooks
A directory containing example git hooks for signing and pushing on commit.
Only use them when you know what you are doing.

.lumiera_c_skeleton
A script which instantiates a new pair of .c/.h files.

.vg-run.sh
convenience wrapper script to run an executable with valgrind
using "typical options"; output goes to a logfile, which is
fed to less afterwards.

A valgrind suppression file is generated automatically, in
case there is an executable "vgsuppression" located in the same
directory as the target executable.

.gnu-indent
call the "indent" tool with parameters suitable for our (GNU derrived) coding style

.testrunner
Script driving make and running a test, possibly under valgrind. Works only
for autotools build.

.vgsuppression_gen.sh
Use an existing 'vgsupression' executable to generate a valgrind supression file.
