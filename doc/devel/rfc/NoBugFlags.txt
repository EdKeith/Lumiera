link:NoBug[] logging flag hierachy
----------------------------------

link:NoBug[] allows hierachical organization of logging flags. Propose a
documentation/planning about the setup.

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
Take a look at my draft at:
link:http://www.lumiera.org/gitweb?p=lumiera/ct;a=blob;f=doc/devel/nobug_flags.t
t;h=74471e255e6ebfedb642e450bdfd3f79e346c600;hb=backend[NoBug_flags]

I've added the things I planning for the backend, others might add their own
plans there too. So far this is an early draft, comments welcome.

NOTE: outdated information. Have a look at `include/logging.h`

Tasks
~~~~~
 * Needs a file.c defining the common root see
   link:Lumiera/DesignProcess/GlobalInitialization[]
 * Everyone needs to setup this hierachy by NOBUG_DEFINE_FLAG_PARENT (flag,
   parent_flag);


Pros
~~~~
When done right, logging control is much easier, just 'NOBUG_LOG=lumiera:DEBUG'
would suffice.

Rationale
~~~~~~~~~
We need some easy way to control logging, later on when lumiera runs in beta
tests it must be easy to tell a tester how to create useable debugging logs.

The basic idea is still valid, but information in this RfC is quite outdated.
Meanwhile, we have a somewhat different and largely extended log hierarchy.
And it turned out, that it isn't practical to scatter the NOBUG_FLAG_PARENT
definitions all over the code base. Rather, we use a single include file
`include/logging.h` to define all flags in a systematic way
