|This is the Lumiera Documentation Tree|

Lumiera documentation is meant to be self contained and included in the main tree.
The 'current' documentation is prepared, collected and tracked in a 'documentation' branch
of the main repository; there, documentation resides in the /doc subdirectory, while the
actual source goes into /src

Moreover, the /doc subdirectory of the documentation tree is linked into the
Lumiera website.
