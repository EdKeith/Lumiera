======================================
Cinelerra -- the video NLE for Linux
======================================

 Cinelerra is a nonlinear video editing and compositing tool. 
 It understands some of the common multimedia formats
 (quicktime, avi, ogg) and audio/video compression
 codecs (divx, xvid, mpeg1/2/4, ...)
 .
 It features non-destructive editing, compositing tools,
 a selection of effects plugins, processing in RGB, YUV
 and RGB-float colormodels and the ability to mix media
 with differing sizes and framerates.

"Cinelerra-3" prototype code
------------------------------

**This source tree doesn't contain a working video editing application**
Rather, it contains some design studies and prototype code for improving
some aspects of the Cinelerra Application. This work may eventually 
evolve into a new major release of Cinelerra.

As of 7/2007, we start here with some backend and render engine modules
together with some unit tests. You should find a wiki with detailed
design considerations and developer documentation and a UML model
(usable with BOUML 2.29) in the sibling directories.
