Design Process
==============

//Menu:   include rfc
//Menu:   include rfc_pending
//Menu:   include rfc_dropped

//Menu:   put child 'rfc_dropped' after 'rfc'

How it Works
------------
Design Process entries (RfC) can be created by anyone.
Each entry goes through several stages until it's accepted (or rejected).
All our RfC entries are filed here, either in the  link:rfc/index.html[RfC accepted] section,
or as link:rfc_pending/index.html[pending RfC] or as link:rfc_dropped/index.html[RfC dropped].

* Every proposal starts out as _*Idea*_, allowing other people to review and comment on it, while still working out details.
* When the _Idea_ is in a proper shape and worked out in most details it becomes a _*Draft*_.
  This _Draft_ need to be carefully reviewed, commented, perhaps corrected and rated by the other Developers.
* We decide on some proposals to talk about that another time, these get a _*Parked*_ state.
* At some point we may decide that a _*Draft*_ becomes a _*Final*_.
  Usually, this happens in our link:/devs-vault/meeting/index.html[monthly developers meetings].
* Sometimes proposals will become dropped for some reason, this is indicated by changing their state to _*Dropped*_,
  they still stay in the system for further reference.

Generally you should refrain from editing someone others proposals (except for typo and grammar fixes)
when this is not acknowledged with the original author. Rather only add comments to the pages and please
care to sign your comments in order to make it easier to find out who is the contact person for some note.

What qualifies as an RfC proposal
---------------------------------
CAUTION: to be written

Handling of RfC entries in practice
-----------------------------------

.Adding a new Proposal:
. Check if there is no similar proposal below! If yes, contact it's author and contribute to that one.
. Think of a good/descriptive _Name-ID_ for the Proposal. It will be used to create a RfC sub-page, so no embedded spaces please.
. [red,yellow]#!TODO!# _please describe how to use the +rfc.sh+ here_.
