Description: Lumiera is a nonlinear video editing and compositing tool. 
 It understands some of the common multimedia formats
 (quicktime, avi, ogg) and audio/video compression
 codecs (divx, xvid, mpeg1/2/4, ...)
 .
 Lumiera features non-destructive editing, compositing tools,
 a selection of effects plugins, processing in RGB, YUV and
 RGB-float colour models and the ability to mix media with
 differing sizes and framerates. Lumiera is especially well
 suited for large and complicated professional editing tasks
 with lots of material, several scenes, nested sequences,
 colour grading, 3D support, full fledged sound montage
 and multiple edit versions prepared in parallel.
 .
 NOTE: as of 1/2011, Lumiera is in early development stage;
 it is not usable yet. The above describes the Lumiera project
 vision, which will need years to implement. This Debian package
 installs a current development snapshot in pre-alpha stage.
