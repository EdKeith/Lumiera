/** @file model-port.hpp
 ** Organising the output data calculation possibilities.
 ** Model ports are conceptual entities, denoting the points where output might
 ** possibly be produced. There is an actual representation, a collection of small
 ** descriptor objects managed by the Fixture and organised within the ModelPortTable
 ** datastructure. Thus, while the actual ModelPort descriptor entities are located
 ** within and managed by the Fixture -- model port as a concept spans the high-level
 ** and low-level view. A model port can be associated both to a pipe within a timeline
 ** in the HighLevelModel, as well as to denote a set of corresponding exit nodes within
 ** the segments of the render nodes network. Model ports are keyed by Pipe-ID and thus
 ** are unique within the application.
 ** 
 ** A model port is rather derived than configured; it emerges during the build process
 ** when a pipe claims an OutputDesignation and some other entity actually uses this
 ** designation as a target, either directly or indirectly. This match of provision
 ** and usage is detected by the Builder and produces an entry in the fixture's
 ** ModelPortTable. Because of the 1:1 association with a pipe, each model port
 ** has an associated StreamType.
 ** 
 ** Because model ports are discovered this way, dynamically during the build process,
 ** at some point there is a <i>transactional switch</i> to promote the new configuration
 ** to be come the valid current model port configuration. After that switch, model ports
 ** are immutable.
 ** 
 ** Model ports are to be accessed, enumerated and grouped in various ways, because each
 ** port belongs to a specific timeline and is used for producing data of a single
 ** StreamType solely. But all those referrals, searching and grouping happens only
 ** after the build process has discovered all model ports currently available.
 ** Thus we provide a MPortRef smart-pointer to ease handling of those access
 ** operations. The actual model port descriptors are owned and managed by
 ** the fixture; they are bulk allocated in a similar manner than the
 ** ProcNode and WiringDescriptor objects.
 ** 
 ** TODO fill in more details?
 ** TODO where to put the ModelPortTable
