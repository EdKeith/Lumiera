Design Proposals not accepted

//Menu: label dropped

-> read link:../rfc.html[more about Lumiera RfC] and the Design Process

The RfC entries listed here where discussed, but then concluded not to be applicable
for some reason. Either the discussion turned up a completely different solution, or
maybe they got just superseded by changing circumstances.

Besides that, sometimes we find an entry impossible to care for and discuss in detail
currently, because we know to be occupied with other stuff. In that case, we put that
entry ``on hold'' (state _*Parked*_). Currently (as of 2/2011) these entries show
up in this category here too.
