Lumiera -- the video NLE for Linux
====================================

*************************************************************
Lumiera is a nonlinear video editing and compositing tool. 
It understands some of the common multimedia formats
(quicktime, avi, ogg) and audio/video compression
codecs (divx, xvid, mpeg1/2/4, ...)

It features non-destructive editing, compositing tools,
a selection of effects plugins, processing in RGB, YUV
and RGB-float colormodels and the ability to mix media
with differing sizes and framerates.

Lumiera pre-Alpha Versions
--------------------------

**This source tree doesn't yet contain a working video editing application** +
Rather, it contains the framework and technology core of the envisioned Application ``Lumiera''.

As of _7/2007_::
we start here with the backend and render engine modules
together with some unit tests. You should find a wiki with detailed
design considerations and developer documentation and a UML model
(usable with BOUML 2.29) in the sibling directories.

As of _2/2008_::
the project has been separated completely from his ancestor ``Cinelerra''
The Community, which is largely identical to the Cinelerra-CV community, choose the
new project name ``Lumiera''. The basic project infrastructure is up and running,
and work on the new codebase is going on continuosely. We can show nothing but
a running test suite for some time to come. 

As of _1/2011_::
the project has created and documented a fairly consistent design,
partially already coded up -- starting from the technical foundations and working up.
The code base is approaching 100k LOC. Roughly half of this is testcode.
The Application can be installed and started to bring up an GTK GUI outline,
but the GUI is very preliminary and not connected to core functionality.
The video processing pipeline is still not complete.
