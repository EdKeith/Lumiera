This directory holds Icons and similar graphics resources for the Lumiera GUI.

- prerendered: Raster image Icons rendered into a selection of sizes
- svg: Scalable Vector Grahpics Icons, to be rendered into suitable sizes
       by the build process. Rendering is done with the help of lib Cairo.
       The build creates an executable from src/tools/rsvg-convert.c
       The invocation of the icon rendering is done with the help of a
       Python script IconSvgRenderer.py, which first parses the SVG document
       and then invokes rsvg-convert to generate the raster images.
