//Menu: label Output handling

Some ideas....

- abstract away the actual technology used for output
- have generic *output designations* and translate them into an *output slot*
- the OutputSlot interface can be designed to match the requirements of the Engine
- assume a mechanism to handle timeouts, glitches and skips within each concrete OutputSlot implementation
