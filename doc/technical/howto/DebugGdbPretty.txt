GDB Python pretty printers
==========================

Since some time, GDB supports Python written extension modules, especially
for pretty printing of data structures. A selection of pre-defined pretty printers
for STL containers is part of the standard distribution. The graphical debugger frontend
provided by the Eclipse CDT automatically uses this debugger provided presentation
to show the value of variables in the detail pane of the variables view, while the
individual variable entries always show the expandable structure view.

Installation notes
------------------

This feature requires an python enabled GDB (>6.8.50). Debian/Lenny isn't enough,
but compiling the GDB package from Debian/Squeeze (GDB-7.1) is straightforward.
Moreover, you need to check out and install the python pretty-printers and 
you need to activate them through your +~/.gdbinit+

.Hello World
[source,C]
----
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

using std::string;
using std::cout;
using std::endl;


int 
main (int, char**)
  {
    std::string str = "hullo w√∂ld";
    std::vector<int> vec (1000);
    
    for (uint i = 0; i < vec.size(); ++i)
        vec[i] = i;
    
    cout << str <<  "\n.gulp.\n";
    return 0;
  }
----
When selecting the string or the vector in the Eclipse variables view
(or when issuing "print str" at the GDB prompt), the GDB python pretty-printer
should be activated.
