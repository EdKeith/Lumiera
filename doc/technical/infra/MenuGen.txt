Notes regarding the +menugen.py+ -- written 2/2011 during our attempt
to get the new Lumiera website online finally.

Known issues
------------

* for sake of simplicity, there is _one_ generated container HTML element
  per menu entry. In case this entry is a submenu, the +<ul>+-element is
  used, _not_ the preceeding headline +<li>+ -- this is due to the fact
  that this submenu entry is going to be collapsed eventually, but has
  the side-effect of highlighting _only_ that submenu block, _not_ the
  preceeding headline.
* the acceptable DSL syntax needs to be documented manually; there is
  no way to generate this information. Doing so would require to add
  specific information methods into Placement subclasses, and it would
  result in duplicated information between the regular expressions
  and the informations returned by such information methods.
  This was deemed dangerous.
* the +__repr__+ of the Placement subclasses is not an _representation_
  but rather a +__str__+ -- but unfortunately the debugger in PyDev
  invokes +__repr__+
* the startdir for automatic discovery is an global variable and indeed
  is used in several un-obvious places and contexts
* when through the use of redirection, the same file is encountered
  multiple times during discovery, it is treated repeatedly, each times
  associated with another node, because, on discovery, the node-ID is
  generated as +parentPath/fileID+, to avoid mixing up similarily named
  files in different directories. (The NodeIndex allows to retrieve
  a node just by its bare ID, without path anyway)
