=== the TiddlyWiki ===
Currently, Lumiera is still in the design- and evolution phase.
There is an embedded JavaScript wiki (TiddlyWiki) within the source tree, mostly
used as design notebook, featuring day-to-day design sketches, notes but also
quite some more persistent planning. Finished documentation text is constantly
moved over to the documentation section(s) of the Lumiera website.
