Summary of The Meeting 
----------------------

. _cehteh_ now Debian package maintainer for NoBug as is  _ichthyo_.
. Discussed the naming convention for the Debian package of the Gnome Docking
  Library, (Lumiera have added some features to this library):  libgdlmm-lum
  and libgdlmm-#-dev; where '#' is a number that changes with each change in
  the ABI to ensure compatibility.
. _cehteh_ reports that progress on the builddrone progressing nicely.
. Discussed improving the Asciidoc documentation in particular the many broken
  links to other documents and how cumbersome it is to get references to other
  documents correct while trying to concentrate on content.
  Moreover, we discussed at Froscon the desire of having some
  automatic means of generating a glossary of terms, i.e., automatically
  generating the glossary.txt files, we decided to do all these things together. 
  _benn_ agreed to write a script that would do the above. The script will be
  called directly by build_website.sh.
. git://www.lumiera.org/website-staging is for experiments and contained the
  new Lumiera site (http://staging.lumiera.org/). This was changed to contain
  the contents of the current Lumiera web site.
