/** @file typelist.hpp
 ** A template metaprogramming technique for manipulating collections of types.
 ** Effectively this is a taylored and simplified version of what can be found in the Loki library.
 ** We use it in other generic library-style code to generate repetitive code. If you tend to find
 ** template metaprogramming (or functional programming in general) offending, please ignore the 
 ** technical details and just consider the benefit of such an simplification for the user code.
 **
 ** Interface for using this facility is the template Types(.....) for up to 20 Type parameters
 **
 ** @see lumiera::visitor::Applicable usage example
 ** @see typelisttest.cpp
