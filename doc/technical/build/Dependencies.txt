Lumiera is written for GNU/Linux. We try to make the best out of modern system programming techniques
to reach the best possible performance. Lumiera shall scale with the provided Hardware,
the more RAM and the more/faster CPU's you have the better.
Nevertheless lower end 32bit machines are supported too.

Secondary targets will be other free operating systems which offer a decent Posix API. +
Porting to other more or less similar platforms will be possible, if -- by coincidence -- 
Someone(TM) helps with porting.

Having said that -- for the time being, the core team won't spend much effort on porting.

Platform
--------
We work and test on PC hardware, 32 and 64 bit. It is intended that Lumiera supports
other platforms running run GNU/Linux.
Lumiera expects a 'standard' desktop installation running a Xserver.

Graphics::
  There are no special requirements for the graphic system.
  Hardware accelleration will likely be added later through extensions,
  but will remain strictyl optional. (For now we'll watch the evolution
  in that area and might revisit that topic when there are more compelling
  and widely supported solutions available)

Disks::
  Video editing requires decent disk speed, so it is suggested to use a
  fast/big array of disks configured as raid.

Special Hardware::
  Sopport for special hardware would be possible, but depends on certain conditions
+
* we need access / donations for the hardware
* specs and APIs must be open.
* someone to do the actual interfacing and support needs to join the team


Languages and Tools
-------------------

* C / C++

 - a C99 / C++98 compatible compiler
 - GCC 4.4 or better is fine. Basically we try to use just the stock language.
   On rare occasions, we _did_ use some GCC extensions, but there would be workarounds,
   should this become a problem.
 - std::tr1 extensions for C++ (smart-ptrs, hashtables, function objects)
 
* BOOST (listed below are the DEBIAN package names)
 - libboost-dev (at least 1.40)
 - libboost-program-options-dev
 - libboost-program-options-dev
 - libboost-filesystem-dev
 - libboost-regex-dev

* Script languages
 - Python (2.5) for build scripts
 - bash (some test scripts use bash specific extensions)
 - Lua is planned to become a general glue and binding language

Build Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~

* Git
* SCons
* pkg-config
* Doxygen

We maintain a Debian package (debhelper, CDBS, git-buildpackage)

Libraries
~~~~~~~~~

* BOOST
* NoBug
* http://gmerlin.sourceforge.net/gavl.html[GAVL] (for raw media support) 
* for the GUI: gtkmm-2.4 gdl-1.0 libglibmm-2.4 cairomm-1.0 xv
 - libgtkmm-2.4-dev
 - libcairomm-1.0-dev
 - libgdl-1-dev
 - libglibmm-2.4-dev, requiring glib2.0 and gthread-2.0
 - libxv-dev
 - librsvg-2.0 and librsvg2-dev for rendering Icons
