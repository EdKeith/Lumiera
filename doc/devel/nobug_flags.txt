NoBug debugging flags hierachy
==============================

NoBug logging is controlled by flags which can be configured with the
NOBUG_LOG environment variable. This flags can be hierachically
organized.

The documentation about this hierachy is maintained here:

 (PLANNED, not all are implemented yet)

all                                     # global logging
  lumiera                               # standard
    library                             # all support library

      file_all                          # filehandling subsystem
        file                            # file access
        filedescriptor                  # internal filedescriptors
        filehandle                      # posix filehandles
        filehandlecache                 # mrucache for filehandles
      mmap_all                          # file mapping subsystem
        mmap                            # mmap objects
        mmapings                        # mmap range containers
        mmapcache                       # mmap range containers
      cache_all                         # caching subsystem
      scheduler_all                     # all scheduler
        threads                         # threadpool management
        tasks                           # work requests

          idle                          # low priority queue
    proc                                # all proc
    gui                                 # all gui
  detail                                # highly expensive logging
    profiler                            # performance stats

event                                   # controling events
  ui                                    # by user interface
  script                                # by script

Explanation
-----------

We have 2 main log flag hierachies, 'all' and 'event'.
 * 'all' reflects the application progress and will be used for
   debugging the application by the programmers. This is exposed in 2
   subgroups: 'lumiera' which is used for normal application logging
   and, 'detail' which contains logging which might be time critical,
   expensive or of very high volume.
 * 'event' logs user actions like GUI clicking, menu selections giving
   an idea how a bug was triggered.

Later on this main hierachies will run in different ringbuffers.

In Short
--------

use NOBUG_LOG=lumiera
