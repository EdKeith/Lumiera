====================================
Lumiera -- the video NLE for Linux
====================================

 Lumiera is a nonlinear video editing and compositing tool. 
 It understands some of the common multimedia formats
 (quicktime, avi, ogg) and audio/video compression
 codecs (divx, xvid, mpeg1/2/4, ...).

 It features non-destructive editing, compositing tools,
 a selection of effects plugins, processing in RGB, YUV
 and RGB-float colormodels and the ability to mix media
 with differing sizes and framerates.

----------------------------
"Lumiera" prototype code
----------------------------

**This source tree doesn't yet contain a working video editing application**
Rather, it contains the initial framework and core modules of the lower and
middle layer of the envisioned new Application "Lumiera".

As of 7/2007, we start here with some backend and render engine modules
together with some unit tests. You should find a wiki with detailed
design considerations and developer documentation and a UML model
(usable with BOUML 2.29) in the sibling directories.

As of 2/2008 the project has been separated completely from its
ancestor "Cinelerra". The Community, which is largely identical to the
Cinelerra-CV community, chose the new project name "Lumiera". The
basic project infrastructure is up and running, and work on the new
codebase is going on continuously. We can show nothing but a running
test suite for now.
