# List of source files containing translatable strings.
#
# As of 10/2013, this is a leftover from the initial GUI development and is currently not used.
# This list can be considered fairly complete.
# Please note: starting with SCons 2.3 there is a gettext builder which mostly automates
# this build task. When we're about to care for i18n, we'll probably use a mechansim to
# detect the files with translatable strings automatically.
