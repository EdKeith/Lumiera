/** @file model-port-registry.hpp
 ** Mutation and management facility for model ports within the builder.
 ** Model ports denote the points where output might possibly be produced.
 ** While client code accesses model ports only as immutable descriptors handled
 ** through an (opaque) reference, the builder is in charge of detecting and organising
 ** any (new) model ports arising as the result of the build process. Changes to the set
 ** of current model ports are to be activated with an atomic <i>transactional switch.</i>
 ** 
 ** builder::ModelPortRegistry thus acts as management interface and factory for model ports.
 ** A given instance of this registry can be promoted to be "the" model port registry reflecting
 ** the current active model ports. Within the Lumiera application, the builder subsystem cares
 ** for setting up such a registry, while all other parts of the system just access the current
 ** model ports through the mobject::ModelPort frontend.
 ** 
 ** TODO fill in more details?
 ** 
 ** @see ModelPort
 ** @see OutputDesignation
 ** @see ModelPortRegistry_test
