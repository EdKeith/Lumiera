Contributing to Lumiera
=======================

The Lumiera project uses an infrastructure based on *Git*, the distibuted
sourcecode management software. This deliberately places the barrier for
contributing very low: No formal ``commit right'' is necessary; you can
start right away and present your first results in the _mob repository_.

For starters, follow the
http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gittutorial.html[basic
instructions] for using Git, notably the following parts:

------------------------------------------------------------
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name Comes Here"
$ git config --global user.email you@yourdomain.example.com
------------------------------------------------------------

If you followed the link:building.html[building-lumiera tutorial], you created
already a local clone of the Lumiera repository. So you are ready to go,
you can edit build and commit your changes to the lumiera code locally in
your cloned repository. Please commit frequently, do small commits which
fix/improve only one single thing and use meaningful commit messages.

Check that you didn't break anything, by running the testsuite.

Finally you can push your changes to the lumiera server to the 'mob' repository:

------------------------------------------------------------
$ git push git://git.lumiera.org/lumiera/mob master:refs/heads/YOURNAME 
------------------------------------------------------------

This creates a new branch 'YOURNAME' on the mob repository. Then you notify the
other devs on the mailinglist and they may merge your code into the mainline.
