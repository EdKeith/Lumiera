Conclusions
-----------

. ichthyo removed most of the tiddly wikis, and worked the content into the website
. cehteh reports that Lumiera got another donation (75Eur), arrangements with
  the ffis to get access (view) about the donations account are under way. We'll
  ask donors then if they want to be published or stay anonym and will set up
  a wiki page listing donations and expenses.
. ichthy rewrote the SCons build, as discussed last time
. cehteh writes a very short RfC, to document that we're using SCons for now.
. possibly no one going to LAC, too far away
. we discussed a link checker / link resolver for the website.
  The idea is to have a semi automatic tool, which is used locally when
  authoring website content to find cross references.
. benn and ichthyo follow up on the libregraphics magazine and try to get into
  discussion with them and see what can be done within our limited time.
  ichthyo respond to the mail, and put you (benn and ct) on CC.
. when it comes to have a working example for media file output, we stick to the
  mainstream solutions ffmpeg and or gstreamer, but care not to lock ourselves
  into a single solution. Concluded that we do this over plugin interfaces and
  it mostly boils down to support ffmped .. and investigate something simpler too.
