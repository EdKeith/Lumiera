Design Documents: GUI
=====================

In the early stages of the project, there was a lot of debate regarding
GUI concepts and -features and proposals.
link:GuiDiscussion/index.html[here] is a collection of documents from these discussions.

In our discussions, *Workflow* denotes all considerations how certain tasks
can be achieved within the application in the most suitable and stringent fashion.
This effort is closely related to GUI and interface design, but at the same quite
integral, so its rather treated separately of individual GUI features.
-> link:../workflow/index.html[more here...]

.*TODO* more contributions please... ;-)
We had several additional discussions and contributions on the mailinglist,
several people did even concept drawings. Collect these and add them here
