-> read link:../rfc.html[more about Lumiera RfC] and the Design Process

The RfC entries listed here where proposed but not finally decided or agreed on --

* entries in the _*Idea*_ stage are yet to be worked out in detail. Usually they
  just sit there and only receive occasional discussions, until the original author
  considers them mature and puts them on agenda on some developers meeting.
* entries in the _*Draft*_ stage are basically ready for discussion or decision;
  but sometimes they are kept _on hold_ -- maybe there is something controversial
  or some details need to be investigated further.
* sometimes we just decide to postpone the discussion -> see
  link:../rfc_dropped/index.html[dropped and parked entries]
