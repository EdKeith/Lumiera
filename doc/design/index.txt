Lumiera is to be a professional tool for video editing on
GNU/Linux systems.  The vision of the development team defines a modern design
for the core of a Non-Linear Editing software.  A key aspect of Lumiera
is strong separation between the user interface and the processing core.
Lumiera will have a GTK GUI but that will not be
exclusive; other GUIs can be written, even by users,
as well as scripts to drive the core.
This is made possible by an ongoing effort to decrease coupling. Each major
component in the application strives to be open to extensions, but closed
against external modification. The presentation, the model and the ``performing''
of the model are separate and self-contained parts of the application.  Lumiera
as a processing core will be able to perform any conceivable
task on video and audio, even some unrelated to video editing.

.Workflow
*****************
The word ``workflow'' is used to name the way tasks can be achieved in an
application. Any operation in Lumiera must be possible in the most suitable and
stringent fashion. The workflow is closely related to how flexible the GUI is
but is also the concern of deeper and more technical parts of the application.

Overview
--------

Lumiera is built from numerous subsystems.  This
overview will provide a general description of the major components
from the highest to the lowest level. Lumiera 
is composed of three main areas with a few additional extra components. We discuss
these areas below.

Graphical User Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

User interfaces are implemented as plug-ins. As a consequence, it is
possible to interface with Lumiera through scripts. It is also possible to create
specialised GUIs.  The interface is the component that is closest to the user. It
provides purely visual interaction with the user. There the user manipulates,
organizes, loads, configures all sorts of data, especially MObjects (media
objects) and Assets. These elements are contained within a structure called the Session. +

The Processing Layer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The processing layer (``Proc-layer'' or ``proc'') has several closely related aspects.
When the user works with the GUI, all the clips, effects and other components presented
there are actually stored within the _Session model_ (``high-level model''). Any editing
operations initiated by the user are actually performed there. Next, after each change,
a component known as _the Builder_ assembles the contents of this model and transforms
them to form a network of nodes, which can be _performed_ efficiently for rendering.
Often, we refer to this node structure as the ``low-level model''. On rendering or
playback, the Proc-layer is responsible for accessing this node structure to 
generate individual _frame render jobs,_ ready to be handed over to the backend, which
performs the actual rendering calculations. +

The Backend
~~~~~~~~~~~

The backend uses the low-level model and the _render jobs_ generated by Proc.
It actually performs the rendering operations and makes heavy use of the
Input/Output System for accessing media content and sending generated data to
the screen or to external output. +

Extra Components
----------------

The Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The application controls the initialization and shutdown procedures as well as
loading external elements such as plug-ins, which are widely used throughout
Lumiera. It acts as the framework which supports core component operations. This
framework is complemented by a library of commonly used components, algorithms and data structures. +
-> link:application/index.html[Application framework]


link:plugins/index.html[Plugins]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Plug-ins play an important role within Lumiera since the application relies
heavily on current FLOSS implementations and external libraries. Moreover, the
application will be configurable and can be extended in various
ways; whenever some extension isn't permanent or will be used only on demand, it
is packaged as a separate module into a plug-in. For example, the GUI of Lumiera
is a plugin. +
